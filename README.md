# Stock Trades API

Stock Trades API app using Node.js, Fastify, Typescript and Mongodb Atlas.

- We are using a cloud Mongodb Atlas database, so no need for a DB configuration.
- Since this is a private test repo, the database url is added already to `.env` file
- `.env` file should be added to the `.gitignore` 

### Skipped tasks
- I was planning to add some UI views using Handlebars but there was no time left for it
- I didn't use Docker as there is no other services running locally (still it's good to have)

## Run 
`npm start`
Just it, no further action is needed.
The app will be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Test 

`npm run test`
